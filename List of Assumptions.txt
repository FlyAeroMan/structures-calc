List of Assumptions:
•	Negligible weight
•	Potted Ends don’t Contribute to calculations
•	Isotropic, Heterogeneous, Elastic
•	Prismatic, Thin-Walled, Semi-Monocoque Member
•	σxx >> σyy & σzz
•	Plane Cross-Sections perpendicular to the Longitudinal axis remain plane & perpendicular to the deformed longitudinal axis
•	ΔT = 0
•	Plane Cross-Sections Warp
•	Warping Is Unconstrained
•	Warping Displacements are small
•	Projection of the Warped Cross-Sections on y-z Plane is the same on the Original Cross-Section
•	Projection of the Warped Cross-Section rotate on the rigid plane
