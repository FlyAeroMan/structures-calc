List of Assumptions:
•	Negligible wieght (Gravity doesn't affect calculations)
•	Glue is Weightless and holds bonds together perfectly
•	Potted Ends don’t Contribute to calculations
•	Expoxy is Weightless
•	Isotropic, Heterogeneous, Elastic
•	Prismatic, Thin-Walled, Monocoque Member
•	σxx >> σyy & σzz
•	Plane Cross-Sections are perpendicular to the deformed longitudinal axis
•	ΔT = 0
•	Plane Cross-Sections Warp
•	Warping Is Unconstrained
•	Warping Displacements are small
•	Projection of the Warped Cross-Sections on y-z Plane is the same on the Original Cross-Section
•	Projection of the Warped Cross-Section rotate on the rigid plane
•	Angle of Rotation, φ, for a Cross-Section is a Constant
•	Shear Flow is Constant
